## myQ garage door and other myQ-enabled device support for [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io).
</DIV>
</SPAN>

`homebridge-myq` is a [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) plugin that makes myQ-enabled devices available to [Apple's](https://www.apple.com) [HomeKit](https://www.apple.com/ios/home) smart home platform. myQ-enabled devices include many smart garage door openers made primarily by Liftmaster, Chamberlain, and Craftsman, but includes other brands as well. You can determine if your garage door or other device is myQ-enabled by checking the [myQ compatibility check tool](https://www.myq.com/myq-compatibility) on the myQ website.
